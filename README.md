# Sales Report

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this report is to conduct an in-depth analysis and provide extensive insights into various aspects such as sales, profit, orders, profit margin, and a range of comparisons. The goal is to deliver a clear and comprehensive understanding of key performance indicators (KPIs) and emerging trends by leveraging the capabilities of Power BI. This report will serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders, offering data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions and enhance overall business performance.

### Data Source

The data used in this report is sourced from Excel, ensuring that the analysis is based on accurate and well-organized information. Excel serves as the primary data source, providing a reliable foundation for the insights presented. The comprehensive dataset, extracted and maintained in Excel, enables precise examination and visualization of sales, profit, orders, and profit margins within Power BI.

### Tools

- Excel: For Data Cleaning
- Power BI: Data Visualization


### Steps to follow for an end-to-end Power BI Project:

1. Data Collection: Gather all necessary data from relevant sources.
2. Power Query: Extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data.
3. Date Table Creation: Generate a date table for time-based analysis.
4. Data Modeling: Create and organize the data model within Power BI Desktop.
5. Report Development: Design and develop reports using Power BI Desktop.
6. DAX Calculations: Implement Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for advanced calculations and data manipulation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Calculate Total Sales: Determine and display the total sales value for the chosen period, enabling users to understand the overall revenue generated.
2. Calculate Profit: Compute and visualize the total profit based on sales data, providing insights into financial performance.
3. Analyze Orders: Examine the number of orders placed during the selected period to identify sales patterns and trends.
4. Calculate Profit Margin: Compute and visualize the profit margin percentage, allowing users to evaluate the profitability of products or services.
5. Compare Sales by Product with Previous Year: Compare the sales performance of each product between the selected period and the previous year, highlighting growth or decline.
6. Compare Sales by Months with Previous Year: Evaluate sales performance across different months, comparing the selected period to the previous year to identify significant changes.
7. Display Top 5 Cities: Visualize the top 5 cities based on sales, helping users quickly identify the most profitable locations.
8. Compare Profit by Channel with Previous Year: Compare profit generated by each channel between the selected period and the previous year to highlight improvements or challenges in profitability.
9. Analyze Sales by Customer and Compare with Previous Year: Examine sales data by customer, showcasing individual performance and comparing it to the previous year.
10. Create Slicers for Date, City, Product,
11. Channel: Provide interactive slicers for selecting specific dates, cities, products, and channels, enabling dynamic filtering and personalized analysis.

### Results/Findings

In 2019, our sales performance faced significant challenges, with an overall decrease of more than 10%. This decline affected all top 7 products, indicating widespread issues.
A deeper look into our customer base shows that the drop in sales is primarily due to four key customers. These customers, historically major revenue contributors, significantly reduced their purchase volumes. Understanding why this happened is crucial for developing strategies to regain their business and stabilize sales.
On a positive note, our profit margins in the export channel are higher than in other channels. This suggests our strategies in the export market are effective, even with overall sales declines. Leveraging this success could help mitigate some domestic losses.
In summary, while 2019 highlighted significant sales challenges, particularly with top products and key customers, the higher profit margins in the export channel provide a promising opportunity. Addressing customer attrition and capitalizing on export market strengths will be essential going forward.

### Recommendation

To address the challenges we faced in 2019, we recommend several strategic actions. First, we should develop customer retention plans by understanding and addressing why four key customers reduced their purchases. Personalized outreach and tailored promotions can help us regain their business. We need to conduct a market analysis to identify the factors behind the sales decline of our top 7 products, including analyzing market trends and competitive activities.
We should leverage our success in the export channel by exploring new international markets and strengthening existing relationships. Investing in marketing and sales to boost export sales is crucial, given the higher profit margins. Innovating and diversifying our product line to meet changing customer needs is essential. We can introduce new products or enhance existing ones based on market research. Implementing targeted marketing campaigns will help us increase brand visibility and attract new customers. Optimizing our operational efficiency to reduce costs and maintain profit margins, even with fluctuating sales volumes, is also important. By focusing on these areas, we can stabilize and grow our sales while capitalizing on our strengths in the export market.

### Limitation

The success of market analysis and product innovation depends on the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to misguided strategies and decisions.
